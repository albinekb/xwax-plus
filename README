# eXwax

eXwax (**e**xtended **xwax**) is a fork of xwax, an amazing piece of software by Mark Hills, aiming to offer more features.
Most of these features reside in their respective branch in this repository and can be checked out and compiled.
If you wish to use several of the features create a new branch and merge the features you want into that branch and compile.

List of currently implemented features:

- **Cue points** *(Branch: dicer_stuff):*

    Now displayed in waveforms. Saveable and auto loads if present.  

- **Novation Dicer** *(Branch: dicer_stuff):*

    Modified mapping, e.g. track browser navigation (details will follow)  

- **Live BPM-Pitch** *(Branch: bpm-pitch):*

    BPM displays are no longer static

- **Vinyl Scroll** *(Branch: feature_scroll):*

    Use the last minute of the timecode signal on your record as a scroll wheel to scroll through your track/crate list

- **Vinyl Flip** *(Branch: feature_flip):*

    Flip your vinyl to load the following track.
    
- **Cover art display** *(Branch: features_ui, ported from xwaxed):*

    Displays cover art of currently selected track in browser
     
- **Extended track browser** *(Branch: features_ui):*

    Added 'album' and 'genre' column display + sorting functions
    
    
... more to come.


**A Massive LARGE UP! to Mark Hills and all the xwax contributors** for the time and effort put in to create such fantastic software.  
Feel free to contact me for any improvments and ideas! I'm not a professional C programmer, and would love to improve the source code. Some of it is a bit hacky!
As well as the branches, please excuse the untidyness.

Thank you.
