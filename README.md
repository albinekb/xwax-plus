eXwax
=====

eXwax (extended xwax) is a fork of xwax by Mark Hills, aiming to offer more features.
most of these features reside in their respective branch.

Currently implemented:

- cue points (Branch: dicer_stuff):
    displayed in waveforms. saveable and auto loads if present.
    
- novation dicer (Branch: dicer_stuff):
    changed mapping, e.g. track browser navigation (details will follow)

- live bpm-pitch (Branch: bpm-pitch):
    bpm displays are no longer static

- vinyl scroll (Branch: feature_scroll):
    use the last minute of your record as a scroll wheel to scroll through your track/crate list

- vinyl flip (Branch: feature_flip):
    flip your vinyl to load the following track.
    
- cover art display (ported from xwaxed) (Branch: features_ui):
    displays cover art of currently selected track in browser
                (both of these are currently in the ui_features branch)
- extended track browser (Branch: features_ui):
    added 'album' and 'genre' column + sorting functions
    
    
... more to come.


A Massive LARGE UP! to Mark Hills and all the xwax contributors for the time and effort put in to create such fantastic software.  
Feel free to contact me for any improvments and ideas! I'm not a professional C coder, and would love to improve the source code. Some of it is a bit hacky!
As well as the branches, please excuse the untidyness.

Thank you.
